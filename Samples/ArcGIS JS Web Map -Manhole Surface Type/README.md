# ArcGIS JavaScript Web Map: Manhole Surface Type

## About
This mini-application demonstrates how to call the geojson query in RJN Clarity API to display manhole inspections. 

In this example, I chose to render the layer based on the "MACP Location Code" field. If your inspection data is not MACP,
or doesn't have that field filled out, you may need to modify the code to use a different field that you do have filled out.

## To Run The Demo
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in Visual Code if you don't already have it.

3. In the command popup, search and click "Live Server - Open with Live Server". This will launch the demo in your default browser.
